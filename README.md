# Excel Dashboard for Bike Sales Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an Excel dashboard for analyzing bike sales data. The dashboard provides insights into bike sales among different customer segments, including gender, income, age, and commute distance. The analysis includes charts and pivot tables to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

## Data Cleaning

Before creating the dashboard, I performed data cleaning to remove duplicate values, ensuring the data is accurate and reliable for analysis.

## Features

### Pivot Table

I created a pivot table to summarize and aggregate the data. The pivot table is the foundation for the dashboard and allows for dynamic filtering and analysis of the dataset.

### Dashboard Sections

1. **Gender Analysis**: The dashboard provides an overview of bike sales based on the gender of customers and their average income. You can see the distribution of bike purchases among males and females and how it relates to their income.

2. **Age Analysis**: I also analyzed bike sales based on the age of customers. The dashboard shows the distribution of bike purchases in different age groups.

3. **Commuter Distance**: You can explore the relationship between customer commute distance and bike purchases. The dashboard includes visualizations that help you understand if commute distance influences purchase decisions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Excel file (`bike_sales_dashboard.xlsx`) using Microsoft Excel or an equivalent spreadsheet software.
